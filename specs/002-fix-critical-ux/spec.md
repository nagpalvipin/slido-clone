## ⚡ Quick Guidelines
- ✅ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ❌ Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- 👥 Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-08
- Q: When a host forgets their host code and needs to recover access to their event, what recovery mechanism should be available? → A: Skip recovery for now
- Q: How should the system handle concurrent host code validation when multiple users try to create events with the same custom host code simultaneously? → A: First-come-first-served with database-level uniqueness constraint (second user sees error)
- Q: When an attendee loses internet connection while submitting a question, what should happen to that submission? → A: Not needed yet (optimization deferred)
- Q: When a host has created many events (e.g., 50+), how should the event switching interface work? → A: Paginated list with next/previous navigation
- Q: What specific visual feedback should attendees see immediately after successfully submitting a question? → A: Question appears in list with highlighted/animated entry

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Stories

#### Story 1: Attendee Question Submission
**As an** event attendee  
**I want to** submit questions during an event  
**So that** I can participate in Q&A sessions and get my questions answered by the host

#### Story 2: Host Question Management
**As an** event host  
**I want to** see all questions submitted by attendees in real-time  
**So that** I can moderate, answer, and manage the Q&A session effectively

#### Story 3: Custom Host Code Selection
**As an** event creator  
**I want to** choose my own memorable host code during event creation  
**So that** I can easily remember and share access credentials with co-hosts

#### Story 4: Host Code Visibility
**As an** event host  
**I want to** see my host code prominently displayed on the dashboard  
**So that** I can share it with co-hosts and log back in to manage future events

#### Story 5: Multi-Event Management
**As an** event host  
**I want to** create multiple events from my dashboard  
**So that** I can manage all my events from a single interface without navigating away

### Acceptance Scenarios

#### Issue 1: Attendee Question Submission
1. **Given** an attendee is viewing an active event  
   **When** they type a question in the question form and click "Submit"  
   **Then** the question appears in the questions list immediately  
   **And** the question is saved to the system  
   **And** the host can see the new question on their dashboard

2. **Given** an attendee submits a question  
   **When** the submission is successful  
   **Then** the attendee receives visual confirmation via the question appearing in the questions list  
   **And** the newly added question is highlighted with animation to draw attention  
   **And** the question form is cleared for new input

3. **Given** an attendee submits an empty or invalid question  
   **When** they attempt to submit  
   **Then** they receive clear error feedback  
   **And** the submission is prevented

#### Issue 2: Host Question Visibility
1. **Given** a host is logged into their event dashboard  
   **When** an attendee submits a question  
   **Then** the question appears on the host's dashboard within 2 seconds  
   **And** the question displays the full text, timestamp, and vote count

2. **Given** multiple questions exist for an event  
   **When** the host views the questions tab  
   **Then** all questions are displayed in order of popularity (votes) and recency  
   **And** the host can see the status of each question (submitted, approved, answered, rejected)

3. **Given** a host refreshes their browser or logs back in  
   **When** they access the event dashboard  
   **Then** all previously submitted questions are still visible  
   **And** the question count is accurate

#### Issue 3: Custom Host Code Selection
1. **Given** a user is creating a new event  
   **When** they reach the host code field  
   **Then** they can enter their own custom host code (meeting format requirements)  
   **And** they can see validation feedback if the code is invalid or already taken

2. **Given** a user leaves the host code field empty during event creation  
   **When** they submit the form  
   **Then** the system automatically generates a secure host code  
   **And** displays it to the user immediately after creation

3. **Given** a user tries to use a host code that's already in use  
   **When** they attempt to create the event  
   **Then** they receive an error message indicating the code is already taken  
   **And** are prompted to choose a different code

4. **Given** two users simultaneously try to create events with the same custom host code  
   **When** both submit at nearly the same time  
   **Then** the first request succeeds and the second receives a uniqueness constraint error  
   **And** the second user must choose a different host code

#### Issue 4: Host Code Display on Dashboard
1. **Given** a host has logged into their event dashboard  
   **When** they view the dashboard  
   **Then** their host code is prominently displayed at the top of the page  
   **And** includes a "copy to clipboard" button for easy sharing

2. **Given** a host clicks the "copy host code" button  
   **When** the action completes  
   **Then** the code is copied to their clipboard  
   **And** they receive visual confirmation (e.g., "Copied!" message)

3. **Given** a host needs to share event access with co-hosts  
   **When** they view the host code section  
   **Then** they also see the event's short code for attendees  
   **And** clear instructions on how to share both codes

#### Issue 5: Multi-Event Creation
1. **Given** a host is on their event dashboard  
   **When** they want to create another event  
   **Then** there is a clearly visible "Create New Event" button  
   **And** clicking it opens the event creation form without losing their current session

2. **Given** a host creates a second event  
   **When** the event is created successfully  
   **Then** they can switch between managing different events  
   **And** each event maintains its own host code and settings

3. **Given** a host has created multiple events  
   **When** they view their dashboard  
   **Then** they can see a list or menu of all their events  
   **And** can navigate between them easily

4. **Given** a host has created many events (50+)  
   **When** they access the event switcher  
   **Then** the events are displayed in a paginated list  
   **And** they can navigate using next/previous controls

### Edge Cases

#### Question Submission Edge Cases
- What happens when an attendee loses internet connection while submitting a question?
  - Network failure handling is out of scope for this phase - standard browser error handling applies
- What happens if an attendee submits a very long question (>1000 characters)?
  - System should enforce character limit and show remaining character count
- What happens when an attendee tries to submit multiple questions rapidly?
  - System should accept all valid submissions without rate limiting (unless spam detected)

#### Host Code Edge Cases
- What happens when a host tries to use special characters or spaces in a custom host code?
  - System should validate and reject invalid formats with helpful error message
- What happens when all possible short host codes are taken?
  - System should generate longer codes or use additional character sets
- What happens if a host forgets their host code?
  - No recovery mechanism in current scope - host must save their code securely

#### Multi-Event Edge Cases
- What happens when a host tries to create events with duplicate slugs?
  - System should prevent duplicate slugs and suggest alternatives
- What happens when a host has 100+ events?
  - Dashboard should paginate event list with next/previous navigation (default page size: 20 events)
- What happens when a host logs out and back in?
  - System should remember all their events and allow access to all
