# Feature Specification: Live Q&A & Polls Application

**Feature Branch**: `001-build-a-slido`  
**Created**: 2025-10-06  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Build a Slido-like live Q&A & Polls application for use in an in-person or virtual course. Requirements: - Hosts create events (title, slug). Hosts can create polls and open/close them. - Attendees join by slug or short code; attendees may be anonymous or provide a display name. - Polls support single-choice and multi-choice. Poll results are shown live (counts + percentages). - Attendees can post questions into a moderated queue. Questions are initially hidden; hosts approve or reject. - Attendees can upvote questions; upvotes reorder the queue in real time. - The presenter (host) view shows live poll results and the queue (with ability to approve/hide). - Authentication can be optional for attendees; host access is protected by a host code. - Persistence: use SQLite for local development. API should be simple REST endpoints + WebSocket events. - Acceptance criteria: realtime updates for votes and questions; persistent storage; basic UI for presenter and attendee."

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-06
- Q: What is the maximum number of attendees expected to participate simultaneously in a single event? ‚Üí A: Medium classes (50-200 attendees)
- Q: How long should poll and question data be retained after an event ends? ‚Üí A: Permanent (never automatically deleted)
- Q: What is the expected frequency of poll creation during a live event? ‚Üí A: High - 5-10 polls per session
- Q: What level of moderation control should hosts have over the Q&A system? ‚Üí A: Minimal - Auto-approve all questions, host can only hide inappropriate ones
- Q: What authentication level do you prefer for attendees joining events? ‚Üí A: Optional identity - Attendees can choose to provide a display name or remain anonymous

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
An instructor wants to engage their course attendees through live polls and Q&A sessions. The instructor creates an event, shares the join code with attendees, launches polls to gather instant feedback, and manages a question queue where attendees can ask questions and vote on others' questions. All interactions happen in real-time during the course session.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** an instructor has course content ready, **When** they create a new event with title "Advanced JavaScript" and slug "js-advanced", **Then** they receive a host dashboard and join code for attendees
2. **Given** an event exists with slug "js-advanced", **When** an attendee enters the slug, **Then** they can join as anonymous or provide a display name and access the attendee interface
3. **Given** a host has created a single-choice poll "What's your experience level?", **When** they open the poll, **Then** attendees can vote and see live results with vote counts and percentages
4. **Given** an attendee is in an active session, **When** they submit a question "How does async/await differ from promises?", **Then** the question appears in the host's moderation queue as pending approval
5. **Given** multiple questions exist in the queue, **When** attendees upvote questions, **Then** the queue reorders in real-time by vote count
6. **Given** a host sees pending questions, **When** they approve a question, **Then** it becomes visible to all attendees immediately

### Edge Cases
- What happens when an attendee tries to join with an invalid slug?
- How does the system handle when multiple attendees vote simultaneously on the same question?
- What occurs when a host tries to close a poll that's actively being voted on?
- How does the system behave when attendees lose network connection during voting?
- What happens when a host deletes an event while attendees are still connected?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

**Question & Answer System**
- **FR-015**: System MUST allow attendees to submit text questions
- **FR-016**: System MUST auto-approve and display questions immediately upon submission
- **FR-017**: System MUST allow hosts to hide inappropriate questions after they are posted
- **FR-018**: System MUST display all visible questions to attendees in real-time
- **FR-019**: System MUST allow attendees to upvote questions
- **FR-030**: System MUST provide minimal moderation interface focused on hiding rather than pre-approval
- **FR-020**: System MUST reorder question queue by upvote count in real-time
- **FR-021**: System MUST prevent duplicate voting by the same attendee on the same question

**Real-time Updates**
- **FR-022**: System MUST broadcast poll result updates to all connected attendees within 100ms (supporting up to 200 concurrent attendees)
- **FR-023**: System MUST broadcast question queue changes to all participants within 100ms (supporting up to 200 concurrent attendees)

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

- **Event**: Represents a course session with title, slug, short code, host authentication, creation timestamp, and active status
- **Poll**: Belongs to an event, contains question text, answer options, poll type (single/multi-choice), status (draft/open/closed), and creation timestamp  
- **PollOption**: Individual answer choice within a poll, contains option text and vote count
- **PollResponse**: Records attendee votes, links attendee to poll option, includes timestamp
- **Question**: Submitted by attendees, contains question text, attendee identifier, approval status, upvote count, and submission timestamp
- **QuestionVote**: Records upvotes on questions, links attendee to question, prevents duplicate voting
- **Attendee**: Represents session participant with optional display name, anonymous flag, session identifier, and join timestamp
